Steganography is the technique of hiding secret data within an ordinary file or message in order to avoid detection. It was originally developed to hide sensitive information in public posters thereby allowing the rebels and revolutionists to communicate under authoritarian government rule.  Here I have developed a simple steganography tool that allows a user to inject an image into another image and extract it using a secret key.
